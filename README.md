# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analysis

Project Overview
Introduction:
At PwC Switzerland, we recognize the critical importance of diversity and inclusion in today's business landscape. Our telecom client has approached us with a pressing challenge - improving gender balance at the executive management level. Despite dedicated efforts, progress has been elusive. In response, we have embarked on a project to address this issue, leveraging our expertise in diversity and inclusion as a business imperative.

The Business Imperative:
Diversity and inclusion are not just checkboxes; they are vital business drivers. Organizations that embrace diversity benefit from a wider range of perspectives, enhanced creativity, and a stronger ability to navigate the complexities of an increasingly heterogeneous world. Our goal is to help our client unlock the full potential of diversity and inclusion within their organization.

Key Challenges:
Achieving a truly inclusive workplace involves overcoming a series of practical challenges. Here are the primary areas we are addressing:

Strategy: Crafting a comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy is the foundation of success. We are working with our client to develop a clear and actionable plan aligned with their business goals.

Awareness and Education: Building awareness and promoting education around diversity and inclusion is crucial. We are implementing awareness campaigns and training programs to foster a more inclusive culture.

Analytics: Data-driven decision-making is pivotal. We are helping our client calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as gender ratios, turnover rates, promotion rates, and performance ratings for men and women to assess progress accurately.

Inspiration: Inspiring and engaging employees is essential for sustained change. We are developing initiatives to inspire individuals at all levels of the organization to actively contribute to diversity and inclusion efforts.

Measuring Progress:
To define proper KPIs, we are calculating the following metrics:
1.Number of Men
2.Number of Women
3.Number of Leavers
4.Percentage of Employees Promoted (FY21)
5.Percentage of Women Promoted
6.Percentage of Men Hired
7.Percentage of Women Hired
8.Turnover Rate
9.Average Performance Rating for Men and women
